# How to Use

This action must be used in two ways: i) when push on `feature/**` branch and ii) when delete of `feature/**`.

For on push, do this github action configuration: 

```yaml

name: s3-on-demand-action-tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'feature/**'

jobs:
  log:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - uses: mathiasgheno/s3-on-demand-action@main
        env:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          SOURCE_DIR: 'www'

```

Here ara all the configuration you can pass:

| Key                   | Required | Default   |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------|
| LOG_LEVEL             | No       | info      |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     | Yes      | N/A       |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | Yes      | N/A       |
| SOURCE_DIR            | No       | www       |
| AWS_REGION            | No       | sa-east-1 |
| ENVIRONMENT           | No       | N/A       |

    if: github.event.ref_type == 'branch'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
